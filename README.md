# vcpkg-based-project

Ongoing experiment wherein we will try to make a github project that uses vcpkg in a usable fashion.

TODO: 
- Install packages from the list file (is it fast enough to just call `vcpkg install` for each package on every build?)
- Configure Travis/AppVeyor (no tests on Apple yet)
